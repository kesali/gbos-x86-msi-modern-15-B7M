# Sourced from gbos.cfg, before any partition is mounted. stage0's `dmctl create` calls (one per partition, each
# a fresh process that loads libcrypto) run BoringSSL's load-time module hash through SHA-NI, which traps here:
# ~3.7M emulated instructions, ~2 s of boot, all before hook.sh gets to bind the patched libraries. So bind them
# first: this wraps chroot (dmctl's only external command) and does it once, just before the first call.
# Which files, and the sha256 of the exact original each patch needs, come from patched/MANIFEST ("early" lines; written
# by tools/port_build.py). Fail-safe: if this never fires, hook.sh does the same binds later (gbos_bind_patches).
